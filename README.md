DESCRIPTION OF THE TOOL
The Advanced Encryption Tool is a Python-based application with a user-friendly graphical interface built using PyQt5. It provides secure file encryption and decryption functionalities using AES-256 encryption.

Here's a breakdown of its features:

Key Features:

AES-256 Encryption:

Uses strong encryption standards to ensure file security.

Derives a secure key from a user-provided password and a randomly generated salt using PBKDF2 with SHA-256.

File Handling:

Allows users to select files for encryption or decryption.

Supports automatic generation of encrypted files with a .enc extension and decrypted files with a _decrypted suffix.

Graphical User Interface (GUI):

Clean and intuitive interface with clearly defined steps for file selection and password entry.

Includes labeled sections for ease of use:

File selection with real-time updates on chosen files.

Password input field with masking for secure entry.

Action buttons for "Encrypt File" and "Decrypt File" with visual cues and colors.

User Feedback:

Displays success or error messages through pop-up dialogs for encryption and decryption actions.

Provides status updates like file selection confirmation.

Enhanced Security:

Randomly generates initialization vectors (IV) for encryption to improve security.

Encodes encrypted data in Base64 format for portability.

Customizable Design:

Aesthetic design with responsive layouts, larger fonts, and color-coded buttons for better usability.

A personalized footer adds a developer's touch.

Additional Information:

Dependencies: Requires cryptography for encryption operations and PyQt5 for the GUI.

Intended Use: Designed for personal or professional scenarios where file encryption is necessary to protect sensitive data.

This tool emphasizes simplicity and robust encryption, making it suitable for users with varying levels of technical expertise.
